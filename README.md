## Overview
This project presents a hybrid deep learning model designed to improve security monitoring in public spaces. Leveraging computer vision and neural networks, the model can detect potential threats in real-time, ensuring a proactive approach to public safety. The research combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for efficient threat analysis and classification.

## Features
- **Hybrid Model**: Uses a combination of CNN and RNN architectures to analyze visual data for security threats.
- **Real-time Detection**: Processes live video feeds to detect unusual behaviors or security risks as they happen.
- **Scalable Solution**: Can be deployed across various types of public spaces, from small facilities to large open areas.
- **Alert System**: Generates automated alerts when suspicious activities are detected.
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks model accuracy, latency, and detection rates to ensure reliable performance.
